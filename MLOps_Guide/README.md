# MLOps Guide

This repository contains guidelines and best practices for managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle following MLOps.  

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

This guide is structured into three complementary perspectives â€” Machine Learning, Development, and Operations â€” that together form an integrated MLOps workflow. The practices described should not be seen as strictly sequential, but as **iterative and interconnected activities**, reflecting the continuous and cyclical nature of MLOps.

- [Machine Learning](./ml.md)  _Principles and practices for data management, experimentation, and model training._
- [Development](./dev.md)  _Standards for coding, testing, configuration management, and CI/CD automation._  
- [Operations](./ops.md)   _Guidelines for deployment, monitoring, security, and reliability of ML systems._

ðŸ“‘ For a high-level overview of these practices, see the [E-AI Summer Workshop 2025 Presentation](./20250710_WG3-MLOps_best_practices.pptx).
